# Change Log

All notable changes to the "flash-vscode" extension will be documented in this file.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-01-11

### Added
- **Remote Treesitter Selection** (`shift+alt+enter`): A powerful new workflow that combines navigation and selection. Jump to any location and immediately trigger treesitter selection mode upon landing. This allows you to select remote code blocks in a fluid, uninterrupted flow.
- Swapped **Symbol Navigation** keybinding to `ctrl+alt+enter` for better ergonomics and consistency.

## [0.4.41] - 2025-12-31

### Fixed
- **Vim Jumplist Integration**: Manually register jumps in VSCodeVim's jumplist when jumping, ensuring `''` and `ctrl+o` work as expected.

## [0.4.40] - 2025-12-26

### Added
- **Treesitter End Labels**: Added labels to the end of treesitter ranges for clearer scope visualization (e.g., `{a ... a}`).

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where not all available label characters were being utilized in symbol/treesitter mode, ensuring all potential matches are labeled.

## [0.4.21] - 2025-11-18
